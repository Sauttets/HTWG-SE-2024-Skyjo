 How to play:

 1.  Draw a card from the ''Stack'' or ''Trash''
 2a. Swap it with a card from your Field
 2b. Discard it by clicking on the trash
     and flip open a card from your Field

 The goal of the game is to have the least 
 amount of points on the board (closed 
 cards included,they get flipped open at the 
 end of the game). If a row has only cards 
 with the same value the player gets 0 
 points instead of the rows card-values.
