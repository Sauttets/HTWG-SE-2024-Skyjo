# BITTE WARTEN MIT BEWERTEN WIR SCHREIBEN NOCH AN DEN TESTS :D


## Skyjo

 **How to play:**

 1.  Draw a card from the ''Stack'' or ''Trash''
 2a. Swap it with a card from your Field
 2b. Discard it by clicking on the trash
     and flip open a card from your Field

 The goal of the game is to have the least 
 amount of points on the board ( closed 
 cards included, they get flipped open at the 
 end of the game ) . If a row has only cards 
 with the same value, the whole row is not
 counted towards the points.
